# TicTacToe using Composable Architecture

This simple app uses [Composable Architecture](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture).

The `TicTacToeFeature.swift` file contains all the state, the actions and the reduce method. Every time an action is sent from the view, 
the reduce method is executed and modify the state accordingly.
